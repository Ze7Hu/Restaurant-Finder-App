# Restaurant-Finder-App
As a team, we have built a user interface that locates restaurants in specific areas for tourists in new sorroundings and are looking to find restaurants around them. Restaurants names,location,contacts and star ratings will be displayed based on users's input.
The user interfarce has been designed to have a polished looking UI using Tailwind to add both HTML and CSS to style the page.
The UI was created in hopes of making it easier for travellers/tourists to find restaurants closest to them as well as giving them an option to save their search through local storage.


#Usage:

When the user opens the UI, the Home page appears, along with search and other filters for you
When the user enters their locations and then clicks on the search Bar, they will be navigated to Search Fragment. As soon as the user has typed in search bar, they will get 5 options of Restaurant names displayed on the page.
Then when options have be assessed, they can either keep their options or click on search for a change of options

 #User Story
