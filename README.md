# Restaurant-Finder-App
My team has built a user interface that locate restaurants in your secific area for tourists that are in new surrounding and want to find restaurants in there area
The main functionality of it is that it displays Restaurant Names based on User's Input which would be there specific location. The user interface has been designed to have a decent polished looking UI WITH THE USE OF tailwind to add HTML and CSS to apply the look of the page. We created this UI in hope of making it easier for people to find local restaurants around them. Creating a local storage for customer to find the best restaurant closes to them and save there options.

Usage:
When the user opens the UI, the Home page appears, along with search and other filters for you
When the user enters there locations and then click on the search Bar they will be navigated to Search Fragment, As soon user has typed in search Bar they will get 5 options of Restaurant names on the page.
Then when options have be assessed they can either keep there options or use the user can click search for a change of options
